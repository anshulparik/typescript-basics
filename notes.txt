JS:
- JS is considered loosely or dynamically typed, because variable types are determined at runtime and it can 
  change as the code executes.
- This creates the problem, we are not able to spot the error at the time of writing code, error occurs at runtime.
- This is managable for few lines of code base, but for big projects it creates a huge problem.

This is where typescript comes into the picture:

Typescript:
- It is a programming language that build on javascript by adding static types.
- It is a superset of javascript.

NOTE: Typescript is compiled into Javascript. When we create build for our application.

We will use vite to create vanilla ts template:

npm create vite@latest typescript -- --template vanilla-ts
